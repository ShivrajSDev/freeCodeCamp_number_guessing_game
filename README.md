# freeCodeCamp - Number Guessing Game Project

This is one of the projects that requires implementation as part of [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

As part of the [project's requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-number-guessing-game-project/build-a-number-guessing-game), this repository includes the following files:

- A number_guess.sql file that creates a PostgreSQL database needed for passing the test.
- A number_guess.sh bash file that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 for the user to guess. It will also save the user's history in the database in terms of the number of games played, as well as what their best game was (i.e. the fewest number of guesses needed to guess the correct number).
